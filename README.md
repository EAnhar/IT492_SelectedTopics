# IT492 Repository - Software Engineering, Testing, and Microservices
## About
Welcome to my IT492 repository! This collection houses my solutions for the projects assigned in the IT492 course on "Software Engineering, Testing, and Microservices." Each project is neatly organized into separate folders, and below you'll find detailed information about each one.

## Highlights
- **Learning Journey**: Overcame challenges, enjoyed the process, and shared valuable solutions.
- **Skill Development**: Practical insights into software engineering, testing, and microservices.
- **Community Contribution**: Sharing projects to benefit my colleagues.

## Advice
To my peers: Take on these projects independently. It's a fantastic way to refine your coding skills and deepen your understanding of the course concepts.
